          <p>
            The initial challenge was to understand the target audience and
            their needs. Through user research and interviews, we discovered
            that visitors to the website were often in a vulnerable state,
            seeking support and guidance for their mental well-being. It was
            crucial to create a design that exuded trust, compassion, and
            professionalism, while also facilitating easy access to essential
            information.

        After understanding the user flow, I created a sitemap to aid in
        planning and organizing the website's information architecture,
        navigation, and user experience. This strategy serves as a blueprint
        that guides the design and development process. My sitemap for Amnah's
        website was created before designing the specific page layouts, to
        ensure a logical and intuitive structure for the website. The below
        sitemap illustrates how users can navigate through the website,
        indicating the primary navigation menu (Landing page) and secondary
        menus.

      <h1 class="mb-4">Wireframes</h1>
      <p style="max-width: 80%">
        During the design process for Amnah's psychology website, I created
        low-fidelity wireframes to establish the basic structure and layout of
        the user interface. Using Figma, I created wireframes for key pages such
        as the homepage, about page, counselling page, somatic therapy page,
        client info page and contact page. The wireframes focused on presenting
        the essential content elements and overall layout without getting into
        visual design details.

      <h1 class="mb-4">Prototype</h1>
      <p style="max-width: 80%">
        As part of the design process for the psychology website, I created an
        interactive prototype to bring the wireframes to life and provide a more
        tangible representation of the user experience. Using the prototyping
        tool, Figma, I transformed the wireframes into an interactive prototype
        with clickable elements. The prototype allowed me to demonstrate how
        users would navigate through the website and interact with different
        features like the contact form.

      <h1 class="mb-4">Testing</h1>
      <p style="max-width: 80%">
        To gather feedback and test the usability of the prototype, I invited
        friends, family, and potential users to navigate through the interactive
        screens. I observed their interactions, listened to their feedback, and
        made iterative improvements based on their suggestions. This iterative
        process helped me refine the prototype and address any usability issues
        or confusion.

        website. Through wireframing and prototyping, I focused on creating
        clear information hierarchies, intuitive navigation, and seamless
        interactions.
      </p>
      <p style="max-width: 80%">
        One of the key goals of this project was to make important information
        easily accessible to website visitors. By carefully organizing content
        and ensuring logical information flows, users were able to locate and
        access the psychologist's services, contact information, and background
        with ease. The website provided a comprehensive overview of the
        psychologist's practice and expertise.

      <p style="max-width: 80%">
        Throughout the design process of this psychology website project, I
        encountered some challenges that required problem-solving and
        adaptation. The challenges faced were the following:
      </p>
      <ul style="max-width: 80%">
        <li>
          <p>Lack of User Testing Opportunities:</p>
          Due to the nature of this personal project, I faced limitations in
          conducting formal user testing. While I made efforts to gather
          feedback from friends, family, and potential users, the sample size
          and diversity of participants were limited. It was challenging to
          gather comprehensive insights and validate the design decisions based
          on a broader user perspective.
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Balancing Functionality and Visual Design:</p>
          As this project primarily focused on usability and user experience, I
          had to balance functionality and visual design. That is why I
          prioritized functionality and ensured that the website's structure and
          content were user-centered, even if the visual design could be further
          refined.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p style="max-width: 80%">
        Despite these challenges, I approached each obstacle as an opportunity
        for growth and learning. I sought alternative solutions, gathered
        feedback from peers, and adapted my approach when necessary. These
        challenges allowed me to develop resilience, problem-solving skills, and
        a better understanding of the complexities involved in UX/UI design.
