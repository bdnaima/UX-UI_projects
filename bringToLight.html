      <h1 class="project-heading">Project Overview</h1>
      <p class="project-paragraph">
        The aim of this project was to create a visually appealing,
        user-friendly, and informative website that effectively communicates
        Amnah's expertise as a psychologist while providing a seamless and
        engaging experience for visitors seeking mental health support.

    </div>

    <div class="d-flex justify-content-between description mt-5">
      <h1 class="project-heading">Problem</h1>
      <p class="project-paragraph">
        The initial challenge was to understand the target audience and their
        needs. Through user research and interviews, we discovered that visitors
        to the website were often in a vulnerable state, seeking support and
        guidance for their mental well-being. It was crucial to create a design
        that exuded trust, compassion, and professionalism, while also
        facilitating easy access to essential information.

        I constructed a user flowchart to present a visual diagram that
        illustrates the path users will take when interacting with Amnah's
        website. The below diagram depicts the sequence of steps and decision
        points a user encounters, showcasing the different pages and actions
        they engage with during their journey.

        After understanding the user flow, I created a sitemap to aid in
        planning and organizing the website's information architecture,
        navigation, and user experience. This strategy serves as a blueprint
        that guides the design and development process. My sitemap for Amnah's
        website was created before designing the specific page layouts, to
        ensure a logical and intuitive structure for the website. The below
        sitemap illustrates how users can navigate through the website,
        indicating the primary navigation menu (Landing page) and secondary
        menus.

      <p class="project-paragraph">
        During the design process for Amnah's psychology website, I created
        low-fidelity wireframes to establish the basic structure and layout of
        the user interface. Using Figma, I created wireframes for key pages such
        as the homepage, about page, counselling page, somatic therapy page,
        client info page and contact page. The wireframes focused on presenting
        the essential content elements and overall layout without getting into
        visual design details.

      <p class="project-paragraph">
        As part of the design process for the psychology website, I created an
        interactive prototype to bring the wireframes to life and provide a more
        tangible representation of the user experience. Using the prototyping
        tool, Figma, I transformed the wireframes into an interactive prototype
        with clickable elements. The prototype allowed me to demonstrate how
        users would navigate through the website and interact with different
        features like the contact form.

          To gather feedback and test the usability of the prototype, I invited
          friends, family, and potential users to navigate through the
          interactive screens. I observed their interactions, listened to their
          feedback, and made iterative improvements based on their suggestions.
          This iterative process helped me refine the prototype and address any
          usability issues or confusion.

            were able to locate and access the psychologist's services, contact
            information, and background with ease. The website provided a
            comprehensive overview of the psychologist's practice and expertise.

          Throughout the design process of this psychology website project, I
          encountered some challenges that required problem-solving and
          adaptation. The challenges faced were the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 4px">
              Lack of User Testing Opportunities:
            </p>
            Due to the nature of this personal project, I faced limitations in
            conducting formal user testing. While I made efforts to gather
            feedback from friends, family, and potential users, the sample size
            and diversity of participants were limited. It was challenging to
            gather comprehensive insights and validate the design decisions
            based on a broader user perspective.
          </li>
          <li style="margin-top: 16px">
            <p style="margin-bottom: 4px">
              Balancing Functionality and Visual Design:
            </p>
            As this project primarily focused on usability and user experience,
            I had to balance functionality and visual design. That is why I
            prioritized functionality and ensured that the website's structure
            and content were user-centered, even if the visual design could be
            further refined.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 15px">
          Despite these challenges, I approached each obstacle as an opportunity
          for growth and learning. I sought alternative solutions, gathered
          feedback from peers, and adapted my approach when necessary. These
          challenges allowed me to develop resilience, problem-solving skills,
          and a better understanding of the complexities involved in UX/UI
          design.
